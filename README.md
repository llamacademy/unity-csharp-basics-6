# Unity Coding Basics Part 6 - Inheritance & Interfaces

If you've been using Unity for a while, or are just getting started with Unity and decided it's time for you to start learning how to write code - this is the video series you need to start your programming journey!

In this tutorial repository (with [associated video](https://youtu.be/siRvSZzrhRU)), aimed at absolute beginners who have very little to no coding experience whatsoever, you'll learn what Inheritance is (it's not passing on hereditary traits or getting money!), how to use it (you already are using it!), what an Interface is, how to use it, and what the difference between the two are! 


**📝📝📝YOUR HOMEWORK!📝📝📝**

Do some data modeling for enemies that can attack the player. Starting with 3 types: 
1. Melee enemy
2. Ranged enemy
3. Boss enemy

Create inheritance relationships and interfaces to allow you to group common code and variables, define "can-do" relationships that allow you to extend what enemies and bosses can do in the future without significant rework.
